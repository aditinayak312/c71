                  Kanchenjunga trek is a challenging trek and if it is winter, then the difficulty level will be increased. Still, it is very exciting to go along the narrow pathways and the rugged ways to reach the top of many hills and mountains. We felt so special and this trek will be close to our heart forever.

                  The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification.

                  Story: Punjabi boy and Tamilian girl discover love on their college campus. However, their diverse cultures make its culmination a challenge.
Review: For an audience that has been around from the '80s, debutant Abhishek Varman's '2 States' may seem like they are revisiting K Balachander's mega hit 'Ek Duuje Ke Liye' (1981), where the Tamil boy had to cross endless hurdles to patao the Punjabi girl. However, that movie had too much angst and a tragic end.

                        Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (transl. Who am I to you?) also known by the initialism HAHK,[6] is a 1994 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film[7] written and directed by Sooraj Barjatya and produced by Rajshri Productions. The film stars Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan, and celebrates the Indian wedding traditions by relating the story of a married couple and the relationship between their families; a story about sacrificing one's love for one's family. It is an adaptation of the studio's earlier film Nadiya Ke Paar (1982), which was based on Keshav Prasad Mishra's Hindi novel Kohbar Ki Shart.[8]

Earning about ₹1.27 billion worldwide,[3][4][5] Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! became the highest-grossing Indian film. It contributed to a change in the Indian film industry, with new methods of distribution and a turn towards less violent stories. It was the first Indian film to gross over ₹1 billion, and when adjusted for inflation, is the highest grossing Indian film of the 1990s and also still one of the highest-earning Bollywood films ever. Box Office India described it as "the biggest blockbuster of the modern era."[9] The film was also dubbed into the Telugu-language and released with the title Premalayam[10] and was very successful there, ran for more than 200 days.The 14-song soundtrack, an unusually large number, is also one of the most popular in Bollywood history, with popular singer Lata Mangeshkar lending her voice for 11 of the 14 songs in the film.

Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! won five Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actress, as well as winning the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It made a lasting impact on wedding celebrations in India, which often include songs and games from the film.

                                      This illustrated copy of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's much acclaimed book should be made a compulsory reading for all children and teenagers in India. The book is a collection of letters written by Panditji to his beloved Indu (Indira Gandhi's pet name) in the summer of 1928 when she was in Mussoorie away from her Allahabad-based father. The letters attempt to tell the story of the evolution of human race in a fluent way that suits a 10-year-old audience. From the very creation of earth itself to the glory of vedic ages, these letters have successfully encapsulated thousands of years of human history in thirty short letters without missing any major events as such. The other invaluable aspect of this timeless classic is the sneak peak it renders the reader to one of the greatest modern mind that almost singlehandedly shaped post-independence India as we know it today. In these personal letters, Nehru's true self as a highly knowledgeable man with strong convictions on topics in the varied realms of science, history, society and religion is revealed. At a time when India and the rest of the world is battling with growing intolerance and hatred along religious and ethnic faultlines, this book is a must read for people of all ages to appreciate the beauty that a truly liberal and rational mindset exudes.
